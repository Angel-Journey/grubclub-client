# GrubClub

## Description
This developer-focused social-media application allows the user to manage their planning for Potlucks they are either hosting or attending. They can create new post entries, read their posts, update their pre-existing posts, delete their posts, and read other people's posts.

## Planning Story
Brainstormed CRUD-based ideas and reflected on how easier it would be to have one centralized place to manage potlucks instead of trying to organize it through multiple text threads.
