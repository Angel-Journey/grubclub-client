## Problem-solving process and strategy
- Would troubleshoot problems through trial & error and research via Google, stackoverflow, etc.
- If I couldn't find the answer, would seek help from instructors by submitting an issue request

## Unsolved Problems
- Update Location details in Potluck to reflect Google Maps location
- Update styling in list of various Potlucks details
- Index All Users and be able to view that User's Potlucks
